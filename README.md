# 💼 Bank Account System – OOP in C#

A mini banking simulation project built with C# to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 Base `Account` class with deposit and withdraw functionality
- 💰 `SavingsAccount` with interest on deposit
- 🧾 `CheckingAccount` with transaction fees
- 🏦 `TrustAccount` with bonus deposit rewards and limits withdrawals
- ➕ Operator overloading to sum two accounts
- 📋 Utility class to display, deposit, and withdraw from lists of accounts

## 🧠 OOP Principles Applied

| Principle       | Usage                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation   | All account details and operations are encapsulated in classes        |
| Abstraction     | Simplified methods for banking operations (`Deposit`, `Withdraw`)     |
| Inheritance     | Specialized accounts inherit from a common `Account` base class       |
| Polymorphism    | Overridden methods in derived classes for specific behavior           |
